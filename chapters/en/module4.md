<exercise id="3" title=" String Verbs">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

How many times do the lyrics "Let it be" occur in the Beatles Hit song of the same title? 


Tasks:
- Use some of the string verbs you learned in the lecture to count all the times "let it be" (all upper and lower case versions) appears in the string `lyrics`. 
- Save it in an object named `letitbe_count`.

  

<codeblock id="04_03">

- Are you converting `lyrics` to lowercase using `.lower()`?
- Are you using `.count()` with the argument `let it be`?

Let's explore how to add to a list, slice it and convert it into a tuple. 


Tasks:


- Using the list provided, add a `pen`, a `scrap paper`, a `7.3` and a `True` element.
- Find the length of the list after adding the element and save the value in an object named `drawer_length`.
- Slice the list from `4` to `scrap paper`  and save this in an object named `cleaned_junk_drawer`.
- Finally,  convert it into a set and name it `junk_set`.


<codeblock id="04_08">

- The verbs `.append()` and `len()` may be handy.
- You can convert your list to a tuple with `tuple(). 
- Have you sliced keeping in mind the end of the slice is excluded?

Recently Jeremy bought a new Ikea shoe rack.  The packaging included quite a few parts and he is finding it hard to keep track! 


Tasks:
Make a dictionary that includes the quantity of each part included in the Ikea set. 

The shoe rack contained the following parts: 

- 8 `Long Screw`
- 8 `Wood Dowel`
- 2 `Short Screw`
- 1 `Allen Key`

- Construct the dictionary so that the part names are the keys and the quantities of the parts, are the values for the dictionary.
- Name the dictionary `ikea_shoe_rack`.

**Question 1**          

What would be the output of 

```python
df['seed'].sum()
```
<choice id="1" >
<opt text="<code>0</code>" >

Can we sum up a column of dtype `bool`? What values does it sum up? 


</opt>

<opt text="<code>1</code>" >

Can we sum up a column of dtype `bool`? What values does it sum up? 

</opt>

<opt text="<code>6</code>" correct="true">

Great!

</opt>


<opt text="<code>Error</code>" >

</opt>

</choice> 

       
**Question 2**          

```python
df.loc[:,['seed', 'sweetness']].sum(axis=1)
```


<choice id="2" >
<opt text="A single value" >

`axis=1` means we can sum up row-wise.


</opt>

<opt text="2 values, one for each column">

`axis=1` means we can sum up row-wise.


</opt>


<opt text="A value for each row" correct="true" >

Well done!


</opt>

<opt text="<code>Error</code>" >

`axis=1` means we can sum up row-wise. We are calculating the number of `True` values total for `Seed` and `Sweetness`.

</opt>


</choice> 



**Question 3**          

```python
df['shape'].mean()
```


<choice id="3" >
<opt text="<code>round</code>" >

`axis=1` means we can sum up row-wise.


</opt>

<opt text="<code>13.4</code>">

`axis=1` means we can sum up row-wise.


</opt>


<opt text="All the values concatenated together">

Well done!


</opt>

<opt text="<code>Error</code>" correct="true" >

We cannot take the mean of a column of dtype `object`.

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

Let's split up a column of dtype `object`. 

Tasks:

- Split up the column `Birth Date` into 3 separate columns named `Birth_Day`, `Birth_Month` and `Birth_Year`. 
- Name this new dataframe `birthdate_df`.
- Save these as columns in the `canucks` dataframe as dtype `int`.


<codeblock id="04_24">

- Are you using `str.split('-', expand='True')`?    
- Are you saving the columns from the `birthdate_df` back to the `canucks` dataframe?
