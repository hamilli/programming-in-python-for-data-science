<exercise id="2" title="NumPy and Array Questions">

**Question 1**      


Which of the following statements is correct? 


<choice id="1" >
<opt text="Pandas is built using NumPy"  correct="true">

Nice!

</opt>

<opt text="NumPy is built using pandas">

NumPy arrays are the building blocks of Pandas dataframes

</opt>

</choice> 

**Question 2**          

Which of the following statements is ***False*** ? 


<choice id="2" >
<opt text="NumPy arrays can be multi-dimensional">

This is very much true and a very helpful feature. 

</opt>

<opt text="NumPy contains constants and mathematical functions">

This is another benefit of NumPy as it contains multiple other functions and constants 

</opt>

<opt text="NumPy arrays can contain multiple data types"  correct="true">

NumPy arrays must have elements with a homogenous data type. 

</opt>

<opt text="<code>numpy.ndarray</code> is a data type">

We saw that `array` is a data type in the slides.  

</opt>

</choice>  


**Question 3**      


Which verbs would I use to make the following array? 

```python
array([ 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30])
```


<choice id="3" >
<opt text="<code>np.linspace(0, 30, 5)</code>"  >
This would only produce 5 values (all equally spaced from 0 to 30)

</opt>

<opt text="<code>np.zeros(7)</code>" >
This gives an array with only `0` elements. 

</opt>


<opt text="<code>np.ones(7)</code>">

This gives an array with only `1` elements. 

</opt>


<opt text="<code>np.arange(0, 35, 5)</code>" correct="true" >

Great!

<exercise id="4" title= "NumPy Practice">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load. Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

Let's explore how Python compares lists and arrays. 

Tasks:
- Create 2 lists of the same length and save each as objects named  `a_list` and `b_list`.
- Using Boolean operators, what is outputted when you test to see if they are equal? 



<codeblock id="08_04a">

- Are you using `[]` or `list()` notation?
- Are you using `==` to check if the lists are equal?

</codeblock>


<choice id="1" >
<opt text="A single Boolean (Either <code> True</code> or <code>False</code>)"  correct="true" >

This is checking if the lists are equal. 

</opt>

<opt text="A list containing a Boolean value for each pair of elements" >

Use the cell above to help yourself out. 

</opt>

</choice> 


Now let's do the same exercises using arrays.

Tasks:
- Create 2 arrays of the same length and save each as objects named `a_array` and `b_array`. 
- Using Boolean operators, what is outputted when you test to see if they are equal? 



<codeblock id="08_04b">

- Are you using `np.array()` with parentheses to make your arrays?
- Are you using `==` to check if the lists are equal?

</codeblock>


<choice id="2" >
<opt text="A single Boolean (Either <code> True</code> or <code>False</code>)"   >

Use the cell above to help yourself out. 

</opt>

<opt text="An array containing a Boolean value for each pair of elements" correct="true">

NumPy performs the operation element-wise and compares the elements that share the same index location. 

</opt>

</choice> 


This is an example of how useful arrays can be when doing numerical computation! To compare each element in a list would take more code and time for the same result.

<opt text="<code>array([[1., 1.],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; [1., 1.],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; [1., 1.]])</code>">

When we make arrays, it's not like slicing where we exclude the last value.

<exercise id="7" title="Shape, Size, and Dimension">

**Question 1**      


What is the shape of the following array?

```python
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]])

```

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="<code>(7, 2)</code>"  >

Are you getting your columns and rows mixed up?

</opt>

<opt text="<code>(2, 7)</code>" >

Are you counting the number of columns correctly?

</opt>


<opt text="<code>(8, 2)</code>">

Remember the number of rows precedes the number of columns. 

</opt>


<opt text="<code>(2, 8)</code>"  correct="true">

Great!

</opt>

</choice> 


**Question 2**         


```python
array([[[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
        [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9]],

       [[10, 11, 12, 13, 14],

<opt text="<code>.ndim</code>" >
This gives the dimension of the array, which would be 3, not 30. 

</opt>


<opt text="<code>.prod</code>">

This would result in an error.

</opt>


<opt text="<code>.size()" >

Since these are attributes, there is no need for the parentheses. 

</opt>

</choice> 


**Question 3**  

Give an array with `shape` of `(2,3,4,2)`, What is it's `.ndim`?

Let's make a new array and transform it by slicing and transposing.

Tasks:
- Create an array named `arr2` using `np.linspace()` with 6 equally spaced values from 1 to 16 and a shape of (2,3) (You'll need `.reshape()` for this!).
- Transpose the array and name it `arr2t`.
- Finally, slice the new object `arr2t` so it only includes the values 7 and 16. Save this as an object named `sliced_arr2t`.

- Create a new column in the dataframe named `Wealth` where all the values equal `"comfortable"`. 
- Name the new dataframe `canucks_comf`.
- Do conditional value replacement, where if the value in the `Salary` column is null, we replace `"comfortable"` with `"unknown"`.
- Display the new `canucks_comf` dataframe.

<codeblock id="08_15">

- Are you using `canucks.info()`?
- Are you creating `canucks_comf` with `canucks.assign(Wealth = "comfortable")`?
- Are you using `.loc[]` to replace the values in the `Wealth` column?
- Are you using `canucks_comf['Salary'].isnull()` as your condition in `.loc[]`?

**Question 1**      

Which of the following dtypes measures an interval of time? 


<choice id="1" >
<opt text="Timestamp"  >

This is a snapshot in time. 

</opt>

<opt text="timedelta" correct="true">

Great work!

</opt>


<opt text="datetime">

This is a dtype not a measurement

**Question 2**          

What code would you use to create a column with the name of the month from a datetime column?


<choice id="2" >
<opt text="<code>td.month</code>" >

This will produce a numerical value, not the month name. 

</opt>

<opt text="<code>.month</code>">

This will produce a numerical value for a single Timestamp instead of a column. 

</opt>

<opt text="<code>td.month_name()</code>" correct="true">

You got it!

</opt>

<opt text="<code>td.month_name</code>">

So close, but in this case, we need parentheses. 

</opt>

</choice>  


**Question 3**      


Which verb do we use to find the time interval between rows?


<choice id="3" >
<opt text="<code>.diff()</code>" correct="true">

Way to go!

</opt>

<opt text="<code>.difference()</code>">

Not quite. 

</opt>

<opt text="<code>differ()</code>" >

This isn't the function we are looking for.

<opt text="<code>.differ</code>">

Maybe, review the notes a bit more before proceeding.

Let's read in data and parse a datetime column as well as calculate the hockey team's oldest and youngest player. 

Tasks:
- Read in the `canucks.csv` file from the data folder and parse the `Birth Date` column. Save this as an object named `canucks`.
- Find the oldest player's date of birth and save the Timestamp as `oldest`. 
- Find the youngest player's date of birth and save the Timestamp as `youngest`.
- Find the age difference between the two players in years to 2 decimal places. Save this as an object name `age_range`. 
- Display `age_range`.


<codeblock id="08_18">

- Are you using the argument `parse_dates` while reading in the data?
- The oldest player has the `min()` date of birth.
- The youngest player has the `max()` date of birth.
- Are you subtracting the min value from the max value?
- Are you rounding to 2 decimal places?

Let's transform some of the columns in your canucks dataset. Let's also see how many of the players have multiple `T`'s in their name. 

Tasks:
- Convert the `Position` and `Country` columns into uppercase and save this in a dataframe named `canucks_upper`.
- Create a new column in the `canucks_upper` dataframe named `number_ts` where you count the total number of times the letter T (lowercase or uppercase) appears in their name.
- Save this dataframe named as `canucks_upper_ts`.
- How many players have multiple T's in their name? 


<codeblock id="08_22">

- Are you using `.assign` and `.upper()`?
- You will have to convert the lower to `.lower()` first and then `.count('t')`
- The number of players with `number_ts` greater than two can be calculated by filtering on that column and getting the `.shape` of the dataframe.

</codeblock>


How many players have the letter "T" in their name more than once?

<choice id="1" >

<opt text="3"   >

There are more than that! Are you using `.shape[0]`?

Let's practice using the verbs we learned from the lesson to process a string column in our Lego dataset. 

Tasks:
- Convert the `name` column in the `lego` dataset to lowercase and overwrite the dataframe by saving it as an object named `lego`.
- Filter the dataset to find all the Lego sets that contain `"weetabix"` in the `name` column.
- Save this as an object named `lego_weetabix`.
- Replace the word` "weetabix`" in the `name` column of the `lego_wetabix` dataframe with the string `"cereal-brand"`.
- Save this in an object called `lego_cereal`.
- If the row contains the word `"promotional"` in the `name` column, change the entire value to `"cereal-brand freebie"`.
- Display `lego_cereal`.


<codeblock id="08_26">

- Are you using `.assign()` and `.lower()` to convert the name column to lowercase?
- Are you using `str.contains('weetabix')` to filter all the rows? 
- You should be using `assign()` with `str.replace('weetabix', 'cereal-brand')` to replace "weetabix".
- You should be using  `.loc[]` and `str.contains('promotional')` (and a single `=`) to assign new row values.
