Are you ready to start the course **Programming in Python for Data Science**?


<choice>
<opt text="Yes! Let's get this party started!" correct="true">

We love the enthusiasm! Alright let's move on to Module 1. 

</opt>

<opt text="I have a Python background but have not had very much wrangling experience." correct="true">

We recommend taking this course so that you are familiar with `Pandas` and have the fundamentals master for our more advanced Data Science courses. Please continue to Module 1.

<opt text="I don't think this is the right fit for me.">

That's ok. If you don't think this is the right course for you, we hope you find what you are looking for. We still suggest taking a look at what we have to offer in Module 1 before formulating a set opinion.
