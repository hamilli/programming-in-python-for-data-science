# Selecting using .loc[]

## Unordered Indexing


```{python}
cereal
```


Notes: 

Here we have our trusty `cereal` dataframe.

What would we do if we wanted to select columns and rows that don't fall consecutively or if we wanted to rearrange them?

---




```{python}
cereal.loc[[13,73,75], ['name', 'type', 'sugars', 'rating']]
```


```{python}
cereal.loc[[75, 73, 13], ['name', 'type', 'rating', 'sugars']]
```

Notes: 

Let's say we want only the rows labelled:

- `Clusters` (13)
- `Trix` (73), and
- `Wheaties` (75) 

And the columns:

- `name`
- `type`
- `sugars`, and 
- `rating`

How would we obtain them?

We need to specify each column and row label that we want between square brackets `[]`, that follow `.loc[]` and we separate the items that we list in the square brackets with commas.


What if we wanted the rows to be in the order `Wheaties` (75), `Trix` (73) and `Clusters` (13) and columns in the order `name`, `type`, `rating` and `sugars`.

How would we obtain that?    

We would just have to rearranging the order in which we list our rows and columns.
