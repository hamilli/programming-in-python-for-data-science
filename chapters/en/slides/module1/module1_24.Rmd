## Sorting


```{python}
cereal.sort_values(by='rating')
```



Notes:

When we read in our data, it is generally ordered in the same way it is stored. 

We can easily sort the rows of a dataframe based on the values within a column.

The verb that we use for that is `.sort_values()`.

For example, if we wanted to order the cereals based on rating, we could do so by using the argument `by` within the `.sort_values()` verb. 

This allows us to see the cereals with lower ratings on the top.

---



```{python}
sorted_ratings = cereal.sort_values(by='rating', ascending=False)
sorted_ratings
```


Notes: 

What if we wanted the cereals with higher ratings at the top?  

Then we would order them in `descending` order by setting the argument `ascending=False`.

Perfect, now we have the highest rated cereals at the top of the dataframe.
