- Learn how to reset a dataframe's index.
- Combine dataframes using [`.merge()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) and [`.concat()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) and know when to use these different methods.
