# Reshaping with Melt

Notes: <br>

<center><img src='/module3/melt_piv.png' width="80%"></center>

Notes: 



In the previous slide decks, we discussed how `pandas` provides 2 functions for reshaping data; <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.melt.html" target="_blank">`.melt()`</a> and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html" target="_blank">`.pivot()`</a> . 


We are going to spend this next section discussing `.melt()`, which is simply the reverse transformation of `.pivot()`. 

Instead of converting a long dataframe to a wider one as we do in `.pivot()`, we do the opposite and convert a wide dataframe into a longer one.

```{python}
cereal
```




Notes: 

Let's take a look at a subset of our the cereal data we've been working with. 

We can see there are 5 rows and 2 numerical columns; `calories` and `protein`.  
Perhaps we would prefer if this was transformed into a long dataframe.

How would we do it?

## Melt



```{python }
melted_cereal  = (cereal.melt(id_vars=['name', 'mfr'] , 
                              value_vars=['calories', 'protein'], 
                              var_name='nutrition', 
                              value_name='value')
                  )
melted_cereal
```



Notes: 

Let's attempt to melt the `calories` and `protein` columns into a single one named `nutrition` with the values expressed in a column named `value`.

This is the dataframe exactly like we started with when we used `.pivot()` in the last section.

After melting, we can see that the rows are not quite in the same order as before, but we can agree that its what we want.

<center><img src='/module3/melt_right.png' width="60%"></center>


  ```python
melted_cereal  = (cereal.melt(id_vars=['name', 'mfr'], 
                              value_vars=['calories', 'protein'], 
                              var_name='nutrition', 
                              value_name='value')
                  )
  ```
  

Notes: 

Let's try to understand what happened. 


- The identifying column and the columns we wanted to keep are specified in the `id_vars` argument.

- the columns `calories` and `protein` are called in `value_vars` and melted down into a single column named `nutrition`. 

- We named the new column using the argument `var_name`.

- The calorie and protein measurements are housed in the new column named `value` that we name using the `value_name` argument. 
  
Although this verb takes 4 arguments and pivot only takes 3, we do not need to reset our index after melting.
