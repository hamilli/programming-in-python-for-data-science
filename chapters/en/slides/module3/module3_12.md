Up until this moment, we have been working with a single dataframe. Many
organizations split their data into multiple tables and join them
together depending on what columns they need for their analysis.  
There are 2 different verbs we use for joining dataframes together:

  - <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html" target="_blank">`.concat()`</a>;
    A forceful way of joining dataframes across rows or columns. A
    useful analogy is the gluing or taping of 2 pieces of paper together
    so the shapes match up.
  - <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge.html" target="_blank">`.merge()`</a>
    A more precision based approach for combining data on common columns
    or indices. This can be compared to stitching fabric together so
    that the pattern/print lines up.

## Concatenation

Concatenation works extremely well when you have similar dataframes
which both share identical column or row index labels.  
`.concat()` can glue the 2 dataframes together either horizontally or
vertically.

For the next couple of examples, we are going to look at concatenating
with a subset of our original candy bars dataframe.

``` python
candy = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv').loc[:4, 'name': 'peanuts']
candy
```

```out
           name  weight  chocolate  peanuts
0  Coffee Crisp      50          1        0
1  Butterfinger     184          1        1
2          Skor      39          1        0
3      Smarties      45          1        0
4          Twix      58          1        0
```

This dataframe has 5 rows and 4 columns.

## Horizontal Concatenation

`candybars2.csv` is a new dataframe that has additional nutritional
information about each candy bar. You’ll notice that this dataframe has
the same number and order of candy bars and 4 columns.

``` python
candy2 = pd.read_csv('candy_bars2.csv')
candy2
```

```out
           name  calories  fat  sugar
0  Coffee Crisp       260   13     25
1  Butterfinger       798   30     72
2          Skor       209   12     23
3      Smarties       210    6     33
4          Twix       250   12     25
```

We want to combine `candy2` with `candy` horizontally.

We can combine these two dataframes using `pd.concat()` but we need to
clarify on which axis to combine. We use square brackets around the
dataframes we wish to glue together. In the context of dataframes, it’s
normal to refer to `axis=1` as the columns of the dataframe and `axis=0`
as the rows. Since we are performing a horizontal concatenation, we need
to use the argument `axis=1`.

``` python
candy_nutrition = pd.concat([candy, candy2], axis=1)
candy_nutrition
```

```out
           name  weight  chocolate  peanuts          name  calories  fat  sugar
0  Coffee Crisp      50          1        0  Coffee Crisp       260   13     25
1  Butterfinger     184          1        1  Butterfinger       798   30     72
2          Skor      39          1        0          Skor       209   12     23
3      Smarties      45          1        0      Smarties       210    6     33
4          Twix      58          1        0          Twix       250   12     25
```

This results in the same 4 rows but now we have 8 columns.

After inspection, we can see that there are 2 `name` columns, which
isn’t necessary.

``` python
candy_nutrition
```

```out
           name  weight  chocolate  peanuts          name  calories  fat  sugar
0  Coffee Crisp      50          1        0  Coffee Crisp       260   13     25
1  Butterfinger     184          1        1  Butterfinger       798   30     72
2          Skor      39          1        0          Skor       209   12     23
3      Smarties      45          1        0      Smarties       210    6     33
4          Twix      58          1        0          Twix       250   12     25
```

We can remove any duplicate columns by using both `.duplicated()` and
`.loc[]`:

``` python
candy_nutrition.loc[:,~candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()]
```

```out
           name  weight  chocolate  peanuts  calories  fat  sugar
0  Coffee Crisp      50          1        0       260   13     25
1  Butterfinger     184          1        1       798   30     72
2          Skor      39          1        0       209   12     23
3      Smarties      45          1        0       210    6     33
4          Twix      58          1        0       250   12     25
```

This removed one of the `name` columns. The code simply means that we
are selecting all the rows using and only the non-duplicated rows for
columns. You may have noticed a new symbol `~`that we have not seen
before\! Meet the bitwise operator, also known as ***Tilde***.

### Tilde

***Tilde*** gives us the ability to return the compliment of the code
following it. Let’s take a closer look. This code shows us whether a
column is a duplicated column not:

``` python
candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()
```

```out
array([False, False, False, False,  True, False, False, False])
```

Using `.loc[]` without `~` selects only the columns with a “True” value,
similarly to what happens when we filter.

``` python
candy_nutrition.loc[:,candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()].head()
```

```out
           name
0  Coffee Crisp
1  Butterfinger
2          Skor
3      Smarties
4          Twix
```

The ***tilde*** inverses the True/False values so we can select the
opposite values.

``` python
~candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()
```

```out
array([ True,  True,  True,  True, False,  True,  True,  True])
```

</audio>

</html>

---

So, when we select the non-duplicated columns by converting their values
from “False” to “True” using the `~` operator:

``` python
candy_nutrition_cleaned = candy_nutrition.loc[:,~candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()]
candy_nutrition_cleaned
```

```out
           name  weight  chocolate  peanuts  calories  fat  sugar
0  Coffee Crisp      50          1        0       260   13     25
1  Butterfinger     184          1        1       798   30     72
2          Skor      39          1        0       209   12     23
3      Smarties      45          1        0       210    6     33
4          Twix      58          1        0       250   12     25
```

## Vertical Concatenation

The new dataset `candybars_more.csv` has 3 additional candy bars that we
wish to add to the original `candy` dataframe. The columns in this
dataframe have the same order as in the `candy` dataframe.

``` python
candy_more = pd.read_csv('candybars_more.csv')
candy_more
```

```out
           name  weight  chocolate  peanuts
0  Kinder Bueno      43          1        0
1    5th Avenue      56          1        1
2        Crunch      44          1        0
```

<audio controls >

<source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />

</audio>

</html>

---

When we want to vertically combine dataframes (add rows), we use the
argument `axis=0` with `pd.concat()`.

``` python
large_candybars = pd.concat([candy, candy_more], axis=0)
large_candybars
```

```out
           name  weight  chocolate  peanuts
0  Coffee Crisp      50          1        0
1  Butterfinger     184          1        1
2          Skor      39          1        0
3      Smarties      45          1        0
4          Twix      58          1        0
0  Kinder Bueno      43          1        0
1    5th Avenue      56          1        1
2        Crunch      44          1        0
```

After combining them now have 8 rows and the same 4 columns. But wait\!
The index column has non-unique values. It may be a good idea to reset
this so we use our friend `reset_index()` with the argument `drop=True`
to remove the original index:

``` python
large_candybars_cleaned = large_candybars.reset_index(drop=True)
large_candybars_cleaned
```

```out
           name  weight  chocolate  peanuts
0  Coffee Crisp      50          1        0
1  Butterfinger     184          1        1
2          Skor      39          1        0
3      Smarties      45          1        0
4          Twix      58          1        0
5  Kinder Bueno      43          1        0
6    5th Avenue      56          1        1
7        Crunch      44          1        0
```

## Be careful of order\!

`pd.concat()` is great when our dataframes have the same order for each
observation. What happens if our dataframes have different orders for
the candy bars? Let’s use an example with the
dataframe`snacksize_candybars.csv`. This contains the candy bars from
`candy` in a shuffled order.

``` python
snacksize_candybars = pd.read_csv('snacksize_candybars.csv')
snacksize_candybars
```

```out
           name  calories  fat  sugar
0  Butterfinger       798   30     72
1          Skor       209   12     23
2          Twix       250   12     25
3  Coffee Crisp       260   13     25
4      Smarties       210    6     33
```

---

What happens when we concatenate `candy` and `snacksize_candybars` now
that it has different rows?

``` python
pd.concat([candy, snacksize_candybars], axis=1)
```

```out
           name  weight  chocolate  peanuts          name  calories  fat  sugar
0  Coffee Crisp      50          1        0  Butterfinger       798   30     72
1  Butterfinger     184          1        1          Skor       209   12     23
2          Skor      39          1        0          Twix       250   12     25
3      Smarties      45          1        0  Coffee Crisp       260   13     25
4          Twix      58          1        0      Smarties       210    6     33
```

Oh no. This does not look good. You can see that the 2 `name` columns
have different values in each row which means this concatenation would
produce incorrect results\!

### Remember…

The biggest takeaway remark with concatenation is that it works well
when we are trying to glue two dataframes together horizontally or
vertically where the rows and columns are in the same order.

If your dataframes don’t have the same row values, your data will be
displayed incorrectly and therefore your results will also have no
meaning.
