# Summary  

Students are now expected to be able to:

- Use NumPy to create ndarrays with `np.array()` and from functions such as `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()` and `np.ones()`.
- Describe the shape, dimension and size of an array.
- Identify null values in a dataframe and manage them by removing them using `.dropna()` or replacing them using `.fillna()`.
- Manipulate non-standard date/time formats into standard Pandas datetime using `pd.to_datetime()`.
- Find, and replace text from a dataframe using verbs such as `.replace()`. 


Notes:

The assignment will concentrate on the learning objectives as well as building knowledge on existing concepts.
