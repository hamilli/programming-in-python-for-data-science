# Introduction to working with strings

Notes:

<br>

---

## Recap

Let’s first remind ourselves of some of the methods we’ve already
learned such as:

  - `.upper()`
  - `.lower()`
  - `.count()`
  - `.split()`

<!-- end list -->

``` python
instrument = 'Violin'
instrument
```

```out
'Violin'
```

``` python
instrument.upper()
```

```out
'VIOLIN'
```

Notes:

Although we have already introduced you to strings to a certain degree,
processing and working with this data type is an area that will require
a substantial amount of learning.

In this course, we will only scratch the surface when it comes to
strings.

That being said, we do hope to provide you with an adequate foundation
in string processing.

Let’s first remind ourselves of some of the methods we’ve already
learned such as:

  - `.upper()`
  - `.lower()`
  - `.uppercase()`
  - `.count()`
  - `.split()`

When we work with just a general string, we can just use the function at
the end of the object name.

For example, if our string object name was `instrument`.

We could convert to all uppercase characters with `instrument.upper()`

---

``` python
instrument.lower()
```

```out
'violin'
```

``` python
instrument.count('i')
```

```out
2
```

``` python
instrument.split('i')
```

```out
['V', 'ol', 'n']
```

Notes:

Or convert the string to lowercase with `instrument.lower()`.

We could count the number of occurrences of the letter “i” using
`instrument.count('i')`

And split a string on a specified character (for example, in this case,
“i”) using the code `instrument.split('i')`

[33 rows x 6 columns]
```

Notes:

The only problem is that when we work with data, we will be applying
these transformations, not to a single string, but to a whole column of
them.

We saw back in Module 4 that string data is represented in a pandas
dataframe using the dtype `object`.

This is the default dtype given to columns that have a mix of different
data types or if pandas cannot identify the column as any other dtype.

Let’s bring back our `cycling` dataframe to demonstrate how to work with
columns of this dtype.

---

``` python
upper_cycle = cycling.assign(Comments = cycling['Comments'].str.upper())
upper_cycle.head()
```

4  Sep-12-2019 17:28  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1891     12.48  TIRED BY THE END OF THE WEEK.     0
```

Notes:

Remember when we discussed datetimes columns, and we applied time
functions to a whole column by adding `.dt` before the function?

We can use that same syntax style when applying string transformations
to entire columns but this time using `.str`.

Perhaps we wanted the entire `Comments` column from our `cycling`
dataframe in uppercase.

We can use `.assign()` and `.upper` paired with `.str` to transform the
column.

Not too, shabby\!

How about we add a new column that contains the number of times “RAIN”
is counted in `upper_cycle`.

Again we use `.str.count('RAIN')`

``` python
upper_cycle['Comments'].str.split(expand=True)

32     BIKE  FEELING  TIGHT,    NEEDS       AN     OIL    AND  PUMP

[33 rows x 8 columns]
```

Notes:

We’ve also seen this syntax when we used `str.split()` in Module 4 when
we learned about splitting our columns.

Here we split up every word in the `Comments` column and created a new
column for each.

---

``` python
"My favorite colour" + "is Blue"
```

```out
'My favorite colouris Blue'
```

``` python
combined_cycle = cycling.assign(Distance_str = cycling['Distance'].astype('str') + ' km')
combined_cycle.head()
```

```out
                Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance                       Comments Distance_str

3  Sep-12-2019 07:06    Morning Ride  Ride  2192     12.84   Stopped for photo of sunrise     12.84 km
4  Sep-12-2019 17:28  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1891     12.48  Tired by the end of the week.     12.48 km
```

Notes:

Another operation that we’ve lightly touched on is the concatenation of
strings. For instance, when we add 2 strings together:

This can be implemented in dataframes too by concatenating a column with
`str` values with another `str` and create a column:

---

``` python
upper_cycle.head(3)
```

```out
                Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance                   Comments

2  Sep-11-2019 17:23  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1863     12.52  WET ROAD BUT NICE WHETHER
```

``` python
cap_cycle = upper_cycle.assign(Comments = upper_cycle['Comments'].str.capitalize())
cap_cycle.head(3)
```

```out

2  Sep-11-2019 17:23  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1863     12.52  Wet road but nice whether
```

``` python
cap_cycle = upper_cycle.assign(Comments = upper_cycle['Comments'].str.title())
cap_cycle.head(3)
```

```out
                Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance                   Comments

2  Sep-11-2019 17:23  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1863     12.52  Wet Road But Nice Whether
```

Notes:

A new function we haven’t discussed but is quite similar to `.upper()`
and `.lower()` is`.capitalize()` which capitalizes the first word of the
string.

Another is `.title()`, which capitalizes the first letter of every word
in a string.

## Strip

<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.strip.html" target="_blank">`.strip()`
</a>.

``` python
"Sunshine" == " Sunshine "
```

```out
False
```

``` python
string1 = " Sunshine " 
new_string1 = string1.strip()
new_string1
```

```out
'Sunshine'
```

``` python
"Sunshine" == new_string1
```

```out
True
```

Notes:

One function that might not seem that pertinent but is extremely useful
is
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.strip.html" target="_blank">`.strip()`
</a>.

`strip()` removes characters starting or ending a string, with the
default being spaces.

For Example:

To us, reading “Sunshine” and " Sunshine " are the same thing, but to
Python, they are quite different because of the blank space surrounding
it.

The blank space on either side of a string often needs to be removed
depending on the analysis.

We can remove them in the example above using `strip()`.

``` python
cycling.head()
```

```out
                Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance                       Comments
0  Sep-10-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  2084     12.62                          Rain 
1  Sep-11-2019 06:52    Morning Ride  Ride  2531     13.03                           rain
2  Sep-11-2019 17:23  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1863     12.52      Wet road but nice whether
3  Sep-12-2019 07:06    Morning Ride  Ride  2192     12.84   Stopped for photo of sunrise
4  Sep-12-2019 17:28  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1891     12.48  Tired by the end of the week.
```

``` python
cycling[cycling['Comments'] == 'Rain']
```

```out
Empty DataFrame
Columns: [Date, Name, Type, Time, Distance, Comments]
Index: []
```

Notes:

This can be especially frustrating when we are trying to filter
dataframes.

Let’s try to filter our data to find rows where the value for the
`Comments` column is “Rain”.

We can see that index 0 should be filtered out, but pandas does not
recognize it with the trailing blank space.

No rows are outputted. That’s because there is a blank space following
“Rain”.

``` python
stripped_cycling = cycling.assign(Comments = cycling['Comments'].str.strip())
stripped_cycling.head()
```

```out

1  Sep-11-2019 06:52    Morning Ride  Ride  2531     13.03                           rain
2  Sep-11-2019 17:23  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1863     12.52      Wet road but nice whether
3  Sep-12-2019 07:06    Morning Ride  Ride  2192     12.84   Stopped for photo of sunrise
4  Sep-12-2019 17:28  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1891     12.48  Tired by the end of the week.
```

``` python
stripped_cycling[stripped_cycling['Comments'] == 'Rain']
```

```out
                Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance Comments
0  Sep-10-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  2084     12.62     Rain
```

Notes:

Let’s now strip our column using `.strip()` and assigning the changes to
the `Comments` column of a dataframe named `stripped_cycling`.

Since we are using `.strip()` with a dataframe column, we have to add
`.str`.

This time, when we filter on `Rain` on our new `stripped_cycling`
dataframe, pandas filters out the row\!

Ahh, that’s much better\!

32  Oct-11-2019 18:16  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1843     11.79  Bike feeling tight, needs an oil and pump
```

``` python
stripped_cycling['Comments'].str.strip("!").tail()
```

```out
28             Very tired, riding into the wind
29                Really cold! But feeling good
30           Feeling good after a holiday break
31                 Stopped for photo of sunrise
32    Bike feeling tight, needs an oil and pump
Name: Comments, dtype: object
```

Notes:

We are not limited to stripping the values of white space. We can also
strip any other character. Let’s try punctuation\!

We can see that index 30 has a value of `Feeling good after a holiday
break!` in the `Comments` column.

After using `str.strip('!')` we can see that it’s no longer has the
exclamation mark\!
