Notes:

Ok, we have an idea of how we can do some fairly standard strings
processing; however, it’s time we dived a little deeper into this.

There are **MANY** different functions, but we’ll concentrate on a
couple here that we will use often and provide a list of several that
will be useful in future string processing adventures.

Just like in regular text, there will be times in your data analysis
where you will want to replace some of the text within a string.

That’s where `.replace()` comes in.

We usually like our data to be consistent; however; consistency is not
always present even in the best of dataframes.

Let’s take a look at our cycling dataset.

---

``` python
cycling_lower = cycling.assign(Comments = cycling['Comments'].str.lower())
cycling_lower.head(9)
```

```out
                Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance                       Comments
0  Sep-10-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  2084     12.62                          rain 
1  Sep-11-2019 06:52    Morning Ride  Ride  2531     13.03                           rain
2  Sep-11-2019 17:23  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1863     12.52      wet road but nice whether
3  Sep-12-2019 07:06    Morning Ride  Ride  2192     12.84   stopped for photo of sunrise
4  Sep-12-2019 17:28  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1891     12.48  tired by the end of the week.
5  Sep-17-2019 06:57    Morning Ride  Ride  2272     12.45      rested after the weekend!
6  Sep-17-2019 17:15  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1973     12.45           legs feeling strong!
7  Sep-18-2019 06:43    Morning Ride  Ride  2285     12.60                        raining
8  Sep-19-2019 06:49    Morning Ride  Ride  2903     14.57  thankfully not raining today!
```

Notes:

Before we do anything, let’s convert this whole column to lowercase, to
make our life easier.

This means we only need to be replacing 1 version of a single word
instead of taking into consideration all different case versions.

```out
                Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance                       Comments
0  Sep-10-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  2084     12.62                          rain 
1  Sep-11-2019 06:52    Morning Ride  Ride  2531     13.03                           rain
2  Sep-11-2019 17:23  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1863     12.52      wet road but nice whether
3  Sep-12-2019 07:06    Morning Ride  Ride  2192     12.84   stopped for photo of sunrise
4  Sep-12-2019 17:28  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1891     12.48  tired by the end of the week.
```

``` python
cycling_rain = cycling_lower.assign(Comments = cycling_lower['Comments'].str.replace('whether', 'weather'))
cycling_rain.head()
```

```out
                Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance                       Comments
0  Sep-10-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  2084     12.62                          rain 
1  Sep-11-2019 06:52    Morning Ride  Ride  2531     13.03                           rain
2  Sep-11-2019 17:23  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1863     12.52      wet road but nice weather
3  Sep-12-2019 07:06    Morning Ride  Ride  2192     12.84   stopped for photo of sunrise
4  Sep-12-2019 17:28  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1891     12.48  tired by the end of the week.
```

Notes:

You’ll notice in the third row, the word “whether” should have been
spelled “weather”.

Let’s replace this word in the entire dataset with the correct spelling
of “weather”.

With `replace()`, the first argument is the word we are identifying, and
the second is what we are replacing the first argument with.

We can see that the word `whether` has now been replaced with the more
appropriate spelling of `weather`.

## Contains

``` python
cycling_lower['Comments'].str.contains('rain')
```

```out
0      True
1      True
2     False
3     False
4     False
      ...  
28    False
29    False
30    False
31    False
32    False
Name: Comments, Length: 33, dtype: bool
```

``` python
cycling_lower[cycling_lower['Comments'].str.contains('rain')]
```

```out
                 Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance                       Comments
0   Sep-10-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  2084     12.62                          rain 
1   Sep-11-2019 06:52    Morning Ride  Ride  2531     13.03                           rain
7   Sep-18-2019 06:43    Morning Ride  Ride  2285     12.60                        raining
8   Sep-19-2019 06:49    Morning Ride  Ride  2903     14.57  thankfully not raining today!
18  Sep-26-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1860     12.52                        raining
```

Notes:

`contains()` can be used to filter our dataframe.

Instead of checking if a column equals an exact value, we can check in a
pattern is ***contained*** in the column.

For example, what if we want all the rows that have some portion of
“rain”.

This will return a pandas series with Boolean values.

We can combine this and use it as a condition to filter our dataframe on
to obtain all the rows that contain the string “rain”.

If we wanted to, we could use this subset of data to see if our cyclist
Tom was slower on average, on days that it rained\!

---

``` python
cycling_lower.loc[cycling_lower['Comments'].str.contains('rain'), 'Comments'] = 'rained'
```

Notes:

`.replace()` can be somewhat limiting since we saw it can only replace
specific strings that we specify.

What if we want to replace any of the values in the entire dataframe
that contains the word `"rain"` to the word `"rained"`?

We actually know how to do this\!

We can pair our `.contains()` function with conditional value
replacement using `.loc[]`\!

We learned about conditional value replacement back in Module 2. Let’s
see what this looks like.

First, we call our dataframe, and inside the `.loc[]` function, we put
our condition as the first argument and the column we wish to change or
create in the second.

Next, on the right side of the assignment operation be specify the new
value we wish to assign to these rows that meet this condition.

Let’s replace all rows with values that only contains `"rain"` with
`"rained"`.

What does `cycling_lower` look like now?

The rows originally filtered with “rain” in the dataset:

```out
                 Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance                       Comments
0   Sep-10-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  2084     12.62                          rain 
1   Sep-11-2019 06:52    Morning Ride  Ride  2531     13.03                           rain
7   Sep-18-2019 06:43    Morning Ride  Ride  2285     12.60                        raining
8   Sep-19-2019 06:49    Morning Ride  Ride  2903     14.57  thankfully not raining today!
18  Sep-26-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1860     12.52                        raining
```

Have now been been been replaced with “rained” in the `Comments` column:

``` python
cycling_lower[cycling_lower['Comments'] == 'rained']
```

```out
                 Date            Name  Type  Time  Distance Comments
0   Sep-10-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  2084     12.62   rained
1   Sep-11-2019 06:52    Morning Ride  Ride  2531     13.03   rained
7   Sep-18-2019 06:43    Morning Ride  Ride  2285     12.60   rained
8   Sep-19-2019 06:49    Morning Ride  Ride  2903     14.57   rained
18  Sep-26-2019 17:13  Afternoon Ride  Ride  1860     12.52   rained
```

Notes:

The rows originally filtered with “rain” in the dataset have now been
replaced with “rained” in the `Comments` column.

Rows 0 and 1 which both had values of `"rain"` and Rows 7 and 8 which
were both `"raining"` and `"thankfully not raining today!"` respectively
have now all been changed to the just `"rained"`.

Rows 0 and 1, which both had values of `"rain"`, and Rows 7 and 8, which
were both `"raining"` and `"raining today"`, respectively, have now all
been changed to the value `"rained"`.
