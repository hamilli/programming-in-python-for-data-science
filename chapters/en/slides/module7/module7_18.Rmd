Notes: 

We are going to talk about the Python Debugger.

To do so, we are going to examine a piece of code that has a bug in it, and we're going to try to hunt down that bug with the debugger. 

The piece of code we are going to examine is a function called `random_walker`. This function simulates a random walk in two dimensions - so you can walk in any of four directions up, down, left, or right, and each one has a 1/4 chance of occurring.

The function takes in the number of steps that you want as an argument.

For example, if you pass in 10, `random_walker()` will take 10 steps and prints out the location every time and return the squared distance.

Notes: 

The `random()` function that we import in from the `random` library generates a float from 0 and 1. 


---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_03.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

The code works by checking if the number generated is between (upper bounds excluded):

- 0.00-0.25 
- 0.25-0.5
- 0.5-0.75
- or 0.75-1 

Where each internal is pertaining to one of the directions left, right, up, or down.

This means each direction has a 25% chance of happening, but there is a bug in this code that we will soon discover.

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_04.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We are going to run the cell `random_walker(20),` which will print 20 steps. 

It’s hard to know immediately that something is wrong, but you can see that we’ve moved negatively in x directions (to the left) and positive in the y-direction (upwards). 


---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_05.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

If we run it again, we are going to get different outputs since it uses a random number generator `random(),` but weirdly, we see the same thing again. 

We seem to be consistently moving left and up.

When we run it over and over, we see these results repeating. 

Why do we keep moving to the left and up when this function is supposed to result in equal probability for any of the four choices. 

Something seems a little bit suspicious.

What is going on?

Notes: 

To get help in figuring this out, we are going to use something called a `breakpoint()`.

`Breakpoint()` works by stopping the executing process. Now when Python gets to this `breakpoint()` function (which is part of the Python debugger), the code will stop running.

We then can execute the code line by line and attempt to diagnose the problem. 

We run the  `random_walker()` function again to redefine it since we’ve added this `breakpoint()` function. 

Now when the `random_walker()` function is called, it’s going to stop executing at this breakpoint.

Notes: 

This is what is returned. 

We see this `pdb` which stands for python debugger. 

Our code has stopped, and it shows the line Python is currently stopped on, in this case, it's` if rand < 0.25:`

<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_09.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

If we type `print(rand)`, we can see what the random number `rand` was, and it tells us 0.957.


---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_10.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

If we type `n` in the debugger, it runs to the next line. 



---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_11.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We don't expect Python to go into the condition body, which is next in the code since `rand` does not meet the condition. 



---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_13.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

The next 2 lines skip the statement bodies because they are not met as well. 


---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_12.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We do, however, meet the else condition, and so 1 is subtracted from `y`. 
Nothing seems terribly wrong yet.



---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_14.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

Pressing `n` again brings us back to the top of the `for` loop. 


---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_15.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We reassign `rand` a new random value, which turns out to be 0.0057.


---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_16.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

Let's go through another round of these `if` with our new random value. 



---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_17.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We expect to go inside of this first `if` statement because the random number is actually less than a 0.25. Because our values are less than 0.25, we expect to move to the right and add 1 to `x`. 

We run this code, and we moved to the right just like we said we would. 



---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_18.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We keep going and check the next condition.  

This is where things get suspicious. 

We move to the left **and** to the right, which is not the intention of the code. 



---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_20.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

The intention behind this code is that only one of these four directions would be taken. 
If the number was between zero and a quarter, the step would be to the right. If it were between a quarter and a half, the step would be to the left, between half and three quarters, the steps would be up, and between three quarters and one, the step would be down. 

This way, there is always an equal chance of each direction. 

When the random number was .005, it moved in 2 directions, which doesn't make sense since only 1 step was supposed to be taken.  

Here it’s moving to the left, to the right and upward. 


---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_21.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

The reason that this happens is because  the two inner if statements should be `elif` statements and not `if` statements. 

In other words:

*if this is the case, do this* ***but don't do anything else*** *or if this is the case, do this* ***but don't do anything else.***

By accidentally having `if` statements instead of `elif` statements, it was allowing the execution of multiple condition bodies.

Whenever a small number was generated, the movement would be left and right or just left, but it would be impossible to move right without moving left.  

In general, the movement would always be left and up and not right.

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_23.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

So we’ve fixed the code, and we're done with the debugger. 

We stepped through the code step by step, which helped us solve the bug. 

We could try and do in our head, but that can be really hard as code gets more complicated. This breakpoint is convenient because it allows us to actually see what's happening at each step. 


To get out of the debugger, we write `q` for "quit".


---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_24.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We can remove the `breakpoint()` function by deleting it or commenting it out temporarily and run our cell again with the fixed code. 


---

<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s18_25.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

It's really hard to test code that's random since we can't just look at the output and recognize that it’s been fixed.
We can, however, run it a few times and see that steps are now being taken in different directions and things seem a little more reasonable. 



The Python debugger has other functions that can help debug your code and you can explore them in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
