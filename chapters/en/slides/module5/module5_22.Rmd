# Function docstrings

Functions help avoid redundant code but sometimes it takes away some clarity.  Using a function without knowing exactly what it does can make our code less readable. 
***Docstrings*** are the solution to this. 

A ***docstring*** is documentation for the function that has been created.  It is a literal string that comes directly after defining a function. 

In the last section we had our function `squares_a_list()`:
```{python}

def squares_a_list(numerical_list):
    """
    Creates a new list containing the square values of the input list. 
    """
    new_squared_list = list()
    
    for number in numerical_list:
        new_squared_list.append(number ** 2)
    
    return new_squared_list

```

Although our function name is quite descriptive, it could mean various things and how do we know what data type it takes in and returns? 

This is how docstrings can add some clarity. 

The rationale for a docstring is that we need to know how a function works and transforms our input so that someone else (or more likely our future selves) can understand our code later on.

## Docstring Structures

There are different styles of docstrings one can implement but the most popular are: 

- **Single-line**: If it's short, then just a single line describing the function will do (as above).

- **PEP-8 style**: Contains multi-line description and a list of arguments; see  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" target="_blank">here for the full documentation on this style</a>.

- **SciPy style**: The most elaborate & informative; see <a href="https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html" target="_blank">here</a> for further details.

## Single-line Docstring

This is a minimal approach that we saw at the beginning of this section.  It is brief and gives a simple description of what the function does.  This is more acceptable for simple functions. 
```{python}
def squares_a_list(numerical_list):
    """
    Creates a new list containing the square values of the input list. 
    """
    new_squared_list = list()
    
    for number in numerical_list:
        new_squared_list.append(number ** 2)
    
    return new_squared_list
```

## PEP-8 style

This a format that has been created to add some standardization to how docstrings are written. 
This format is particularly useful as `Arguments` makes the input argument data type/structure very clear so that we know exactly what to call when using the function. 
```{python}
def squares_a_list(numerical_list):
    """
    Creates a new list containing the square values of the input list. 
    
    Arguments:
    numerical_list - (list) The list from which to calculate squared values 
    
    """
    new_squared_list = list()
    
    for number in numerical_list:
        new_squared_list.append(number ** 2)
    
    return new_squared_list
```

## SciPy

The SciPy format is the most defined documentation and includes 4 major parts, **a brief description of the function**, the **parameters**, what the function **returns** and even **examples**.

```{python}
def squares_a_list(numerical_list):
    """
    Creates a new list containing the square values of the input list. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    numerical_list : list
        The list from which to calculate squared values 
        
    Returns
    -------
    :list
        A new list containing the squared value of each of the elements from the input list 
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> squares_a_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
    [1, 4, 9, 16]
    """
    new_squared_list = list()
    for number in numerical_list:
        new_squared_list.append(number ** 2)
    return new_squared_list
```

<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Below is the general form of the SciPy docstring (reproduced from the SciPy/NumPy docs):

```python

def function_name(param1,param2):
    """First line is a short description of the function.
    
    A paragraph describing in a bit more detail what the function
    does and what algorithms it uses and common use cases.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : datatype
        A description of param1.
    param2 : datatype
        A longer description because maybe this requires
        more explanation and we can use several lines.
    
    Returns
    -------
    datatype
        A description of the output, datatypes and behaviours.
        Describe special cases and anything the user needs to know 
        to use the function.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> function_name(3,8,-5)
    2.0
    """
```

---

If multiple variables are returned, then the `Returns` section follows the same format as the `Parameter` section:

```python
    """
    Returns
    -------
    return_var1 : datatype
         A description of the output, datatypes and behaviours.
    return_var2 : datatype
        A description of the output, datatypes and behaviours.
        
    """
```

## How to read a docstring

In the very first assignment we learned how to get more help by using `?` on a verb.  The same can be done on the function we have made!
Given our `squares_a_list()` function, we can get the documentation by doing the following: 

```python
squares_a_list?
```

```out
Signature: squares_a_list(numerical_list)
Docstring:
Creates a new list containing the square values of the input list. 

Parameters
----------
numerical_list : list
    The list from which to calculate squared values 
    
Returns
-------
list
    A new list containing the squared value of each of the elements from the input list 
    
Examples
--------
>>> squares_a_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
[1, 4, 9, 16]
File:      ~/<ipython-input-1-9673041d9122>
Type:      function
```
