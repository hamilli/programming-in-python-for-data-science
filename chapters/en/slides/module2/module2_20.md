Notes:

So far, we have accumulated many different skills to wrangle our data.

One type of transformation that you may use often is replacing values
within a column depending on a certain condition.

Let’s bring in a smaller version of our cereal dataset.

In the dataframe, the manufacturer value “Q” isn’t that informative and
it might be easier to understand our data if we change all these values
to something more clear like “Quaker”.

This leads us to our task:

***Replace the `Q` manufacturer values with a new value of `Quaker`.***

---

``` python
q_cereal = cereal[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q']
q_cereal.assign(mfr = 'Quaker')
```

```out
                  name     mfr  type  calories  protein  weight     rating
1    100% Natural Bran  Quaker  Cold       120        3     1.0  33.983679

35    Honey Graham Ohs  Quaker  Cold       120        1     1.0  21.871292
41                Life  Quaker  Cold       100        4     1.0  45.328074

56  Quaker Oat Squares  Quaker  Cold       100        4     1.0  49.511874
57      Quaker Oatmeal  Quaker   Hot       100        5     1.0  50.828392
```

Notes:

Our first instinct may be to first filter those rows using the technique
we learned in our last section.

From our new filtered selection, perhaps we could assign values of
“Quaker” to column `mfr` using similar code to this.

The output looks like it did what we wanted, but what happened to the
rest of our dataframe?

Remember that we only want to replace the values in our existing
dataframe and not create a new one.

When we use the `.assign()` verb like this, it creates a new dataframe
with only the rows that meet the condition `cereal['mfr'] == 'Q'` .

This is problematic since we still want the original dataframe and the
rows with `mfr` values not equal `Q`.

So what do we do?

```

Notes:

Remember our friend `.loc[]`? We are going to get reacquainted with it.

Similarly, to how `.loc[]` can select and return specified columns and
rows of the dataframe, it can filter on conditions too.

We are used to seeing code involving `.loc[]` like this.

But now we’ll get introduced to a new side of it when we use it to
filter as well.

We can use the same syntax, `cereal['mfr'] == 'Q'`, we normally would
when filtering. However, this time we wrap the whole thing within
`.loc[]`.

---

``` python
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr']
```

```out
1     Q
10    Q
35    Q
41    Q
54    Q
55    Q
56    Q
57    Q
Name: mfr, dtype: object
```

``` python
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```

Notes:

Some people may be asking, “Why don’t we do all our filtering like this
then?” Well, the answer is, you can, but we prefer not to.

Filtering without `.loc[]` is a bit more readable.

Let’s concentrate back on our task of only replacing `mfr` values equal
to `Q` to `Quaker`.

How can `.loc[]` help us with this?

Unlike our earlier approach, `.loc[]` accepts more arguments within it.

We have the ability to specify not only the target rows matching a
specific condition but our column of interest as well.

Once we have that, we can then assign these rows the new values `Quaker`
in the `mfr` column.

Wait\! Nothing was outputted with our code\! What happened?

[77 rows x 7 columns]
```

Notes:

Let’s take a look at the original dataframe.

We can now see that the `Q` manufacturer values have changed to
`Quaker`.

When we use this syntax, we do not need to save the results in a new
object like we had to with `.assign()` and `.drop()`.

Let’s discuss what really is happening behind the scenes.

---

``` python
cereal['mfr'] == 'Q'
```

```out
0     False
1     False
2     False
3     False
4     False
      ...  
72    False
73    False
74    False
75    False
76    False
Name: mfr, Length: 77, dtype: bool
```

Notes:

Remember what the condition `cereal['mfr'] == 'Q'` returns?

It produces an object containing all the rows with True/False values
depending on whether or not the row meets the condition.

---

<img src='/module2/tf_quaker.png'  alt="404 image" />

Notes:

Essentially our code is finding the rows with `True` values and
replacing the values in the `mfr` colum with the new value of `Quaker`.

---

1.  
<!-- end list -->

``` python
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q']
```

<br>

2.  
<!-- end list -->

``` python
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] 
```

<br>

3.  
<!-- end list -->

``` python
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```

Notes:

You can split up how this code works into 3 steps:

1.  We use `.loc[]` to find the rows meeting certain conditions.

2.  We next indicate which column we wish to access.

3.  Once we have obtained our desired rows and the column which we are
    editing, we assign a value.

``` python
cereal[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```

``` out

```

Notes:

Does this work without using `.loc[]`?

Let’s give it a try.

Unfortunately, we are not able to replace values in this manner and it
results in an error since filtering this way does not allow us to
specify a column.

---

# Replacing with inequalities

``` python
cereal.loc[cereal['protein'] >= 3, 'protein_level']  = 'high' 
```

``` python
cereal.loc[cereal['protein'] < 3, 'protein_level']  = 'low' 
```

Notes:

This syntax using `.loc[]` also works for inequality conditions.

If we are replacing numerical values with characters or words (or vice
versa) we need to assign our desired values to a **new column** and not
the existing one, because the column type will be different.

Perhaps we want just two categories for protein levels - “high” and
“low”.

Any cereal above 3 grams of protein will be considered a “high” protein
level and anything less, as a “low” protein level.

Let’s assign the “high” protein values first.

The only difference here from earlier is we now use an inequality for
our condition and we designate a new column name instead of an existing
one.

Let’s save the values in a column named `protein_level`.

Next by the “low” values.

Notes:

You may have noticed we did not use `.assign()` to create our new
column.

That’s because as we mentioned earlier, when we use `.assign()` it
creates a brand new dataframe.

When we are replacing values, we don’t want a new dataframe and instead,
we just want to alter the current values in the existing dataframe.

When we are not doing conditional value replacement, we could create new
columns with a similar syntax. Take the example of converting the weight
from ounces into grams and making a new column named `weight_g`.

This code edits the existing dataframe `cereal` instead of creating a
new one.

We prefer to use `.assign()` where possible as it can help avoid
unexpected errors and performance issues.
