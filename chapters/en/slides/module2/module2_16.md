Notes:

Filtering is probably one of the most frequent data manipulations you
will do in data analysis.

Filtering is often used when we are either trying to rid the dataframe
of unwanted rows or trying to analyze rows with a particular column
value.

Let’s try to filter the `cereal.csv` dataset.

---

## Conditions

``` python
cereal['protein'] > 4
```

```out
0     False
1     False
2     False
3     False
4     False
      ...  
72    False
73    False
74    False
75    False
76    False
Name: protein, Length: 77, dtype: bool
```

Notes:

Suppose you are trying to find the information for cereals with a
protein content greater than 4g per serving.

Our first instinct would be to write code that looks somewhat like this.

This can be translated as

*“From the `protein` column in the dataframe `cereal`, which have values
greater than 4?”*

The output shows all the index labels and a column with `True` or
`False` values depending on if the row meets the condition. Cereals with
`True` have a protein content greater than 4 and `False` if they do not.

But we want a dataframe with all the information that only contains the
rows with protein above 4.

How can this be achieved?

---

``` python
cereal[cereal['protein'] > 4]
```

```out
              name mfr  type  calories  protein  fat  sodium  fiber  carbo  sugars  potass  vitamins  shelf  weight  cups     rating
11        Cheerios   G  Cold       110        6    2     290    2.0   17.0       1     105        25      1     1.0  1.25  50.764999
57  Quaker Oatmeal   Q   Hot       100        5    2       0    2.7    1.0       1     110         0      1     1.0  0.67  50.828392
67       Special K   K  Cold       110        6    0     230    1.0   16.0       3      55        25      1     1.0  1.00  53.131324
```

Notes:

To achieve this, we index into our `cereal` dataframe using this column
of True/False values. The result is a smaller dataframe that only
contains the rows corresponding to the `True` values.

This code can be translated to:

*Select the rows from the `cereal` dataframe that, according to the
`cereal` dataframe, have a `protein` values greater than 4.*

We can see from the output that only the rows meeting the condition are
displayed.

By the way, it is a common pattern that we’re using the same dataframe
twice, namely `cereal`, but it’s not strictly required by pandas.

```

Notes:

We can do this with equalities as well.

Now we get all the cereals with a protein content of exactly 4g per
serving.

The key point to remember here is that we use **two** equal signs.

In Python, a single `=` is used as an assignment operator. We are
setting something to equal something else.

The double equal sign operator is used for comparison. We check if
certain values are equivalent to one another.

By the way, these conventions were set a long time ago when people made
the early programming languages. In hindsight, maybe something like `=?`
would have been more clear, but the double equal sign for comparison is
now a standard.

```

Notes:

We can filter categorical columns too. In this example, we only want
cereals from the manufacturer “Q” (For Quaker):

Here, we are using the double equal sign operator that we saw in the
last slide.

Notes:

We now know how to filter on one condition but how do we filter if we
have many?

Perhaps we only want cereals with protein content between 4 to 5 grams?

To find the cereals that meet protein contents greater or equal to 4, we
use the code shown here.

Notes:

We can combine the two conditions using the `&` operator. This allows us
to obtain cereals that meet **both** conditions.

The `&` indicates “and”. This means that both conditions must hold for a
row to be included in the new dataframe.

Each condition is wrapped with parentheses to keep them clearly
separated.

Notes:

Next, we will look at a case where we filter on two different columns.

Let’s say we only want cereals from the Quaker manufacturer, with a
protein content greater than 4.

The same coding syntax can be applied to two different column
conditions.

```

Notes:

Suppose that we are interested in cereals that either are made from the
Quaker manufacturer **OR** a protein content above 4.

For a row to be included in the output, we only require one or the other
condition to hold.

Instead of using the `&` symbol, we use `|` which is called the “pipe
operator”. This means “or” in the Python programming language (and many
other languages).

---

<center>

<img src='/module2/condition_or.png' width = "80%" alt="404 image" />

<center>

Notes:

When we filter using “or” this time, it resulted in 10 cereals that met
either of the conditions.

When we filtered using “and”, only 1 cereal met both conditions.

---

## Tilde

``` python
cereal['protein'] > 4
```

```out
0     False
1     False
2     False
3     False
4     False
      ...  
72    False
73    False
74    False
75    False
76    False
Name: protein, Length: 77, dtype: bool
```

Notes:

We saw that when we filter the conditions are expressed with an
underlying column with `True` or `False` values indicating if the
condition has been met in each row of the dataframe.

But what if I wanted the rows that were the complement (or opposite) of
this?

The opposite of `cereal['protein'] > 4` is `cereal['protein'] <= 4`, so
that one isn’t too tricky. But sometimes taking the opposite is not so
straightforward. This is where the `~` (“tilde”) operator can be
helpful.

---

``` python
(cereal['protein'] > 4).head()
```

```out
0    False
1    False
2    False
3    False
4    False
Name: protein, dtype: bool
```

Tilde converts all the `True` values to `False` and all the `False`
values, to `True.`

``` python
(~(cereal['protein'] > 4)).head()
```

```out
0    True
1    True
2    True
3    True
4    True
Name: protein, dtype: bool
```

Notes:

*Tilde* (`~`) gives us the ability to return the complement of the code
following it.

cereal[~(cereal['protein'] > 4)]

[74 rows x 16 columns]
```

Notes:

We can obtain the complete dataframe by putting the entire condition
within our square brackets like we did before.

What we have here, is taking the rows where the protein content is not
greater than four.

This gives us more versatility when filtering, especially when we want
the inverse of more complicated conditions and verbs (you’ll see this in
Module 3).
