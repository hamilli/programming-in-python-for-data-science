# Grouping and aggregating

_*Which manufacturer has the highest mean sugar content?*_

```{python}
cereal['mfr'].value_counts()
```


Notes: 

Often, we are interested in examining specific groups in our data.  

Perhaps the question we want to answer from the cereal dataset is:     

_*Which manufacturer has the highest mean sugar content?*_

We found in Module 1 using `.value_counts()` that there are 7 different manufacturers; K, G, P, R, Q, N and A.

---



Let's start with "K":

```{python}
cereal[cereal['mfr'] == 'K'].mean()[['sugars']]
```

Next "G":

```{python}
cereal[cereal['mfr'] == 'G'].mean()[['sugars']]
```




Notes: 

To find the mean sugar content of each manufacturer, we could filter on each manufacturer and calculate the mean sugar content using `.mean()`.  We can chain to make this process a little faster too.

Let's start with "K" and then next "G". 

We could do this for the remaining 5 manufacturers. However, it's obvious that this is time-consuming and a lot of work to do this repeatedly.  

Imagine how tedious this would be if we had 100 different manufacturers?

# Using groupby


```{python}
mfr_group = cereal.groupby(by='mfr')
mfr_group
```




Notes: 

Pandas has a solution for this.  

It's not uncommon to be interested in examining specific groups in our data. Hence there is a verb that is helpful in grouping like-rows together.  

`.groupby()` allows us to group our data based on a specified column.

Let's group our cereal dataframe on the `mfr` column and save it as object `mfr_group`.

This returns a `DataFrame GroupBy` object.  

---



<center><img src='/module2/groupby.png'  alt="404 image" width = "70%" align="middle"/></center>

Notes: 

For example if we only had two manufacturers, the output would look like this.

What exactly is a groubpy object though?

---

```{python}
mfr_group.groups
```



Notes: 

A `DataFrame GroupBy` object contains information about the groups of the dataframe. 

We can access it with the `.groups` attribute (noun).

Reading carefully, we can see there are 7 groups: `A`, `G`, `K`,  `N`, `P`, `Q` and  `R`, and it lists the index labels (cereal names) in each group.

---


```{python}
mfr_group.groups['K']
```


Notes: 

We can obtain all the row index names of a group by specifying the group name in square brackets after the `groups` method.  

Take the group `K` as an example.

---



```{python}
mfr_group.get_group('K')
```


Notes: 

We can get the full dataframe of the group `K` alone using the method `.get_group()`.

---



```{python}
cereal['mfr'].value_counts()
```


```{python}
mfr_group.size()
```


Notes: 

Similarly to how we made frequency tables using `.value_counts()`, we can now use `.size()` to obtain the number of rows in each group: 

---

## Summary Statistics with Groups


```{python}
mfr_group.mean()
```

```{python}
mfr_group.max()
```


Notes: 

What now?  

Grouping doesn't answer our initial question of ***Which manufacturer has the highest mean sugar content?***    

Where do we go from here?      

We need to calculate the mean sugar content in each manufacturing group! With a groupby object, this is super simple, as shown here.

Using `.mean()` on our groupby object answers the initial question and confirms that manufacturer "P" has the highest mean sugar content across cereals.  

See how convenient this was to do in comparison to our initial method?  Not only does this give us the result quicker, but it also gives us the mean of each column of the dataframe. 

Think of how many filtering and mean calculations would have to be done if we were to do this using our initial approach.  

Of course, using groups is not limited to finding only the mean. We can do the same thing for other statistics too like `.min()` and `.max()`, or many other operations.

---

## Aggregating dataframes

```{python}
cereal.agg('mean')
```

```{python}
cereal.mean()
```

Notes: 

In situations where we want to collect multiple statistics together, we can aggregate them in one step using a verb called `.agg()`.

`.agg()` can be used on its own using a single measurement, without `.groupby()`.

Using `.agg()` with only a `mean` input is essentially the same thing as calling the statistic `mean()` on the dataframe.

---

```{python}
cereal.agg(['max', 'min', 'median'])
```


Notes: 

`.agg()` gets a chance to really shine when we want several specific measures.  

Let's say we want the `max`, `min` and `median`.  We specify them in square brackets within our `.agg()` method.

This produces a convenient dataframe giving the value for each statistic, for each column.

---

## Aggregating groupby objects



```{python}
mfr_group.agg(['max', 'min', 'median'])
```




Notes: 

`.agg()` is particularly useful with groupby objects.  

Let's try it on our manufacturer `groupby` object named `mfr_group`.

This gives us a value for each group and for each statistic we specified.

For example: 

Look at the '150' in the bottom row on the far left under `calories`. 
The interpretation is that, for cases where the manufacturer is 'R', the max number of calories is 150. 

In a similar manner if the manufacturer is 'P' the minumum amount of sodium is 45. 

---

## Extra Fancy Aggregation


```{python}
mfr_group.agg({"calories":['max', 'min'],
               "rating":['sum'],  
               "sugars":['mean', 'median']})
```

Notes: 

You might have noticed that when we used `.agg()`,  we calculated the same 3 statistics for every column in the dataframe. But we can also calculate different statistics for different columns. 

Let's say we are concerned about the `max` and `min` calorie values, the total `sum` of the ratings and the `mean` and `median` sugar content for each manufacturing group.     

We can achieve this by wrapping everything in curly brackets and using a colon to separate the column name from the statistics values. We need to put the statistics within square brackets. 

The code is a bit more complicated, but the result is a bit easier to read.
