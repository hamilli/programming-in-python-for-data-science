# Column renaming and column dropping

```{python}
candy = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv')
candy
```

Notes: 

Remember our `candybars.csv` dataframe?  

Let's bring it back and save it as object named `candy`.

---

## Column Renaming


```{python}
candy = candy.rename(columns={'available_canada_america':'availability'})
candy
```


```python
 columns={'old column name':'new column name'}
```

Notes: 

There will be times where you are unsatisfied with the column names and you may want to change them.  

The proper syntax to do that is with `.rename()`.  

The column name `available_canada_america` is a bit long. 

Perhaps it would be a good idea to change it to something shorter like `availability`. 

Here is how we can accomplish that.

This code uses something we've never seen before - `{}` curly braces, also called curly brackets.

These have a special meaning but for now, you only need to concentrate your attention on the fact that the argument `columns` needs to have the format shown on the slide.

---

```{python}
candy = candy.rename(columns={'available_canada_america':'availability',
                        'weight':'weight_g'})
candy.head()
```



Notes:

You can also rename multiple columns at once by adding a comma between the new and old column pairs within the curly brackets. 

It's important that we always save the dataframe to an object when making column changes or the changes will not be saved in our dataframe.

---


## Column Dropping 


```{python}
candy.drop(columns='coconut')
```



Notes:

`.drop()` is the verb we use to delete columns in a dataframe. 

Let's delete the column `coconut` by specifying it in the `columns` argument of the `drop` verb. 

---

```{python eval=FALSE}
candy.drop(columns='coconut')
```

```{python}
candy.head()
```


```{python}
candy = candy.drop(columns=['nougat', 'coconut'])
candy.head()
```


Notes: 

If you look again at the code we just wrote you'll notice we didn't save over the dataframe object, so the dataframe `candy` still will contain the `coconut` column.

Let's overwrite the dataframe and remove multiple columns at the same time. 

Let's drop `nougat` and `coconut` together.

We put the columns we want to drop in square brackets and this time we will remember to overwrite over the `candy` object.

Now when we call `candy.head()` it reflects the dropped columns. They're no longer there.
