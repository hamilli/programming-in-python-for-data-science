# What is a Dataframe?

When working with information, it's important that it is stored in as manner that is organised, readable and accessible.    
A **data frame** is a table or a 2 dimensional structure in which **columns** contain values from a variable and **rows** are occurances, examples or data points.

Data frames make it easy to calculate statistics and clean and store data.

Essentially dataframe's look like excel sheets and are a essential part of data science.

Python although a powerful tool, does not have everything we need right away for data science. `Pandas` is an add-on python packages that contain the tools necessary for working with and wrangling data to a state that is functional for analysis and visualisation.

## Importing Pandas

Before we really start writing any valuable code, we need to tell python that we need our extra tools from the pandas package.   

We do this by using the code below:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

We will talk about this further on in the course, but for now, just know that we are equiping our python base with additional abilities.

## Reading in Data

Next we can bring in our data with the following code

```python
df = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv')
```


let's break this up:

`pd` : The package our tool comes from and as we said above we imported `pandas` as `pd`.    
`read_csv()` : The tool that does the job and in this case, it is reading in the `csv` file named `candybars.csv`.   
`df` : The dataframe is now saved as an object called `df`

This object df looks like this 

```out


```

From this database we can see that there are 25 different candybars and 10 columns.
We can obtain the names of the columns using this code:

```python
df.columns
```

```out
Index(['candy bar', 'chocolate', 'peanuts', 'caramel', 'nougat',
       'cookie_wafer_rice', 'coconut', 'white_chocolate', 'multi',
       'available_canada_america'],
      dtype='object')
```

Or if you wanted to see the dimensions of the whole dataframe you could code the following:

```python
print(df.shape)
```

```out
(25, 10)
```

Breaking up this code it just means "From our dataframe that we saved as `df` tell me the  `columns` or tell me the `shape`".

To find out the length of the dataframe, i.e. the number of rows, we can ask for the `length`.

```python
len(df)
```

```out
25
```

Notice in this case we have the name of the dataframe within the `len` brackets. That's because  `len` is a function whereas the others are methods. This is going to be discussed later in this course.  For now, be aware that sometimes we are going to be specifying the dataframe before the tool we are using and sometimes within it.

Another important method to know is what if we don't want to output the whole table   
We can then specify how many rows of the dataset to show with `df.head()`

```python
df.head(2)
```

```out


```
<img src='module1/df_head_2.png' width="70%">   
This specifies only 2 rows will be shown. we can specify any number of rows within the brackets or we can leave it empty which will default to 5 rows

```python
df.head()
```

```out


```
