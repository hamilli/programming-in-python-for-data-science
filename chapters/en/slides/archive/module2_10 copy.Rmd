Remember our `candybars.csv` dataframe?  Let's bring it back. 


```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', index_col=0)
df
```

## Column Renaming

There will be times where you are unsatisfied with the column names and you may want to change them.  The proper syntax to do that is with `df.rename()`.    
The column named `available_canada_america` is a bit long.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to change it something shorter like `availability`. 
Here is the code to do that:


```{python}

df = df.rename(columns={'available_canada_america' : 'availability'})
df.head()

```


This code uses something we've never seen before - {} curly brackets.
These have a special meaning but for now, you only need to concentrate your attention on the fact that the argument `columns` needs to have the format:

```
 columns={'old-column-name' : 'new-column-name'}
```

  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

You can also rename multiple columns at once by simple adding a comma between the new and old column pairs between the curly brackets. 

```{python}
df = df.rename(columns={'available_canada_america' : 'availability',
                        'weight' : 'weight_g'})
df.head()
```


It's important that we always save the dataframe to an object when making column changes or the changes will not be saved in our dataframe.

## Column Dropping 

`df.drop()` is used when renaming the column labels  is not enough and we simply want to drop one or multiple columns completely. 
Let's delete the column `coconut`. 


```{python}
df.drop( columns= 'coconut')
```



Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

If you scroll back to the last slide you'll notice we didn't save over the dataframe object, so the dataframe `df` still will contain `coconut`.

```{python}
df.head()
```

Let's overwrite this and remove multiple columns at the same time. Let's drop `nougat` and `coconut` together. We  put the columns we want to drop in square brackets. 

```{python}
df = df.drop(columns=['nougat', 'coconut'])
df.head()
```
