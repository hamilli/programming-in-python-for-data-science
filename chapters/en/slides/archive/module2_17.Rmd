# Grouping a Dataframe 

Often we are interested in examining specific groups in our data. `df.groupby()` allows us to group our data based on a column

Let's group our candybars dataframe on the `mfr` column. 

```{python}
mfr_group = df.groupby(by='mfr')
mfr_group
```

This returns a `DataFrame GroupBy object`. What is that though?

A `DataFrame GroupBy object` contains information about the groups of the dataframe. We can access it with the `.groups` attribute (noun)

```{python}
mfr_group.groups
```

Reading carefully we can see there are 7 groups: `A`, `G`, `K`,  `N`, `P`, `Q` and  `R`, and it lists the index labels (cereal names) in each group.

</audio></html>

---

We can obtain all the row index names of a group by specifying the group name after. Take the group `K` as an example. 
```{python}
mfr_group.groups['K']
```

</audio></html>

---

We can get the full dataframe of just the group `K` using the method `get_group()`

```{python}
mfr_group.get_group('K')
```

## Summary Statistics with Groups

What now? We have this new groupby object, what do we do with it? We can calculate some summary statistics with them! 

```{python}
mfr_group.mean()
```

This shows up the mean value of each column for each group, we can do the same thing for other statistics too.

Let's try it with the mininum values using `min()` 

```{python}
mfr_group.min()
```

## Aggregating dataframes 

"Aggregating" means to combine elements. 
Luckily there is a particular method that allows us to collect multiple statistics together- aggregating them in 1 step. 
`df.agg()` can be used on it's own:

```{python}
df.agg('mean')
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

but then it is essentially the same thing as calling the statistic `mean()` on the dataframe. 

```{python}
df.mean()
```

  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

`df.agg()` gets a chance to really shine when we want a number of specific measures. Let's say we want just the `max` `min` and `median`. We specify them in squre brackets within our `df.agg()` method. 

```{python}
df.agg(['max', 'min', 'median'])
```
It produces a nice dataframe giving the statistic for each statistic, for each column.

## Aggregating groupby objects

`df.agg()` is particularly useful with groupby objects. 

```{python}
mfr_group.agg(['max', 'min', 'median'])
```

This gives a statistic for each group and for each statistic we specified.

## Extra Fancy Aggregation 

You might have noticed that when we used `df.agg()`,  we calculated the same 3 statistics for every column in the dataframe. 
This doesn't have to be the case. We can calculate different statistic for different columns. 

Let's say we are concerned about the `max` and `min` calorie values, the total `sum` of the ratings and the `mean` and `median` values for each manufacturing group. 

```{python}
mfr_group.agg({"calories": ['max', 'min'], 
         "rating": ['sum'],  
         "sugars": ['mean', 'median']})
```
