Remember our `candybars.csv` dataframe? Let's bring it back. 


```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', index_col=0)
df
```

## Column Renaming

There will be times where you are unsatisfied with the column names and you want want to change them. The proper syntax to do that is with `df.rename()`.    
The column named `available_canada_america` is a bit long. Perhaps it would be a good idea to change it something shorter like `availability`. 
Here is the code to do that:


```{python}

df = df.rename(columns={'available_canada_america' : 'availability'})
df.head()

```


This code uses something we've never seen before - {} curly brackets.
These have a special meaning but for now, you only need to concentrate your attention on the fact that the argument `columns` needs to have the format:

```
 columns={"old column name" : "new-column-name"}
```

---

You can also rename multiple columns at once by simple adding a comma between the new and old column pairs between the curly brackets. 

```{python}
df = df.rename(columns={'available_canada_america' : 'availability',
                          'weight' : 'weight_g'})
df.head()
```

## Column Creation 

Creating a new column is extremely useful when we need to add additional information. Perhaps we want to covert the weight from grams to ounces. We can add that to our current dataframe using the `assign` function and naming the column `weight_oz`. 
The conversion for 1 oz = 28.3495 g. 


```{python}
df = df.assign(weight_oz= df['weight_g']/28.3495)
df
```

It's important that we always save the dataframe to an object when renaming or adding a new column or the changes will not be saved in our dataframe.

## Column Dropping 

Ok, so we know how to create a new column but what if I want to drop 1 or multiple columns? In a similar way to `df.assign()`, `df,drop()` will delete selected columns.
Let's delete the column `weight_oz` that we just made. 


```{python}
df = df.drop( columns= 'weight_oz')
df
```

Again make sure that we always save the dataframe to an object or the column will not be deleted from the dataframe.
