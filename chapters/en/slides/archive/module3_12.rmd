# Hierarchical Indexing

***Hierarchy*** is defined by <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hierarchy" target="_blank">Cambridge Dictionary </a> as

 _*" a system in which people or things are put at various levels or ranks according to their importance."*_ 

This helps explain the concept of ***hierarchical indexing***  which is the capability of a dataframe possessing multiple levels of index labels.

Multi-level indexing allows the possibility of some much more advanced data analysis, however, that can also open the door to more complex issues and bugs. 

We are going to keep this as simple and elegant as possible by introducing you to the concept and how to transform dataframe with hierarchical indexing.

Believe it or not but you have already seen this concept when we explained the concept of grouping and aggregating. 

```{python}
cereal.groupby('mfr').agg(['max', 'min'])
```

Here you can see that each of the original cereal dataframe columns have the sub columns `max` and `min` and that there is a hierarchy of index labels.

## Setting indexes 

You have already learned how to set a single index using `.set_index()`.  Here we are going use the same verb but this time set both `caramel` ***and*** `name` as the indexes for the candy bar dataframe. 
Remember in the last section where we explained that `pandas` doesn't recognize indexes as columns and we needed to `.reset_index()` to makes sure we have all the columns in our dataframe?  The same applies here. We should first reset the index on our `candy` dataframe.


```{python}
candy = candy.reset_index()
candy.head()
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>
---

Next, we can assign multiple indexes using square brackets within `.set_index()` and sort the dataframe according to the index using `sort_index()`.   
(`.sort_index()` is similar to `.sort_values()` however now we can sort by the index!)

```{python}
candy2 = candy.set_index(['caramel', 'name']).sort_index()
candy2
```

To get the entire picture, the image below shows the complete dataset.  It almost looks like there are 2 separate dataframes on top of one another.  One containing non-caramel chocolate bars and the second  containing caramel-filled chocolate bars.

Some of you may now be wondering "How do we select and slice now?".    
The answer is just like before but now we specify 2 indexes! 
To specify 2 indexes, we wrap them in parentheses. 
Perhaps I wanted the non-caramel filled "3 Musketeers" bar.  I would use `0` to represent the first index of "non-caramel filled" and `3 Musketeers` for the bar name.

```{python}
candy2.loc[(0, '3 Musketeers')]
```

This works if I want a specific cell value too.  Let's say I wanted the non-caramel filled "3 Musketeers" bar's weight.

```{python}
candy2.loc[(0,'3 Musketeers'), 'weight']
```

## Stacking 

If this dataframe's organization is not ideal for your analysis you may want to *transpose* your data (swap columns to rows or rows to columns).  This can be done with something called **Stacking**.  Stacking is exactly what it sounds like, we _stack_ our values. 

```{python}
stacked_df = candy2.stack()
stacked_df
```

This dataframe now has all the columns available in a single column and our dataframe has elongated from 25 rows to 225 rows.

## Unstacking 

To unstack our data, we simply used `.unstack()`

```{python}
stacked_df.unstack()
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />

Let's bring back our groupby cereal aggregated dataframe.

```{python}
max_min_df = cereal.groupby('mfr').agg(['max', 'min'])
max_min_df
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

The dataframe is currently unstacked but we can stack the `max` and `min` values, to elongate the dataframe. 

```{python}
max_min_df_stacked = max_min_df.stack()
max_min_df_stacked
```

This now shows the `max` and `min` values for each manufacturer on top of each other instead of side by side.  
Which way do you prefer?
