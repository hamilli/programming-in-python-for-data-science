Here is our `fruit_salad` dataframe once again. 

```out

```

Let's say we run the following code:

```python
fruit_salad.drop(columns = ['colour', 'shape', 'sweetness'])
fruit_salad = fruit_salad.rename(columns={'location':'country',
                                          'weight':'weight_g'})
```

Use the dataframe and code above to answer the next 2 questions.


**Question 1**          
After running the code above, How many columns (not including the index) are there in `fruit_salad` ? 


<choice id="1" >
<opt text='9'>

<opt text='8' correct="true">

Good job! Nothing was dropped since we did not save the changes in an object. 

</opt>

</choice> 


**Question 2**   

After running the code above, which of the following is a column in the dataframe `fruit_salad`? 


<choice id="2" >
<opt text='<code>country</code>' correct="true">

Good job! The code successful renamed the column `location` to `country` since we save the changes in an object named `fruit_salad`.


</opt>

<opt text='<code>location</code>' >

Did the code renamed the column `location` to `country`?  Did we save the changes in an object named `fruit_salad`.

 Make a plot using our Pokemon dataset by chaining actions sequentially.   

Tasks:     
- Chain the following methods in the order specified.
- First, rename the column `capture_rt` to `capture_rate`.
- Then, create a new column named `AD_total` by adding the `attack` and `defense` columns from the pokemon dataset.
- Save this in a dataframe object called `plot_df`.
- Finally use `.mark_circle()` to plot `AD_total` on the x-axis and `capture_rate` on the y-axis.
- Name this plot `pokemon_plot`.
- Use a new line for each method.

**Question 1**          
Which code would create a grouby object for the column `shape`? 

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="<code>fruit_salad.get_groups(by='shape')</code>">

Not quite but you are on the right track. 

</opt>

<opt text="<code>fruit_salad.groupby(by='shape')</code>" correct="true">

Great work!

</opt>

<opt text="<code>fruit_salad.group(by='shape')</code>" >

Not quite but you are on the right track.

**Question 2**         
Consider this output made from the `fruit_salad` dataframe:


<center> <img src='/module2/Q26_2.png'  alt="404 image" /></center>
   
Which of the following code returns the dataframe above. 

<choice id="2" >
<opt text="<code>fruit_salad.groupby(by ='shape').get_group('oval')</code>" correct="true">

Good job!

</opt>

<opt text= "<code>fruit_salad.groupby(by ='shape').get_group['oval']</code>">

Take care of which type of brackets are needed. 

</opt>

<opt text="<code>fruit_salad.get_group(by ='shape').group['oval']</code>">

Are you using the correct verbs?

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time, could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_ 

Find the mean speed of each column for every Pokemon types using `.mean()` and `.groupby()`.

Tasks:
- Make a groupby object on the column `type`.
- Find the mean value of each column for each pokemon `type` using `.mean()` and save the resulting dataframe as `type_means`.
- Obtain the mean speed of each pokemon type from the dataframe `type_means` by using `.loc[]`.
- Save it in an object named mean_speed.
- Display it.


<codeblock id="02_27">

- Are you grouping by the column named `type`? 
- Are you using `.mean()` on the `pokemon_type` dataframe?
- Are you naming the mean speed objects correctly?
- Are you obtaining the mean values using `.loc[]`?

Let's practice using `.agg()`  

Tasks:    
- Make a groupby object on the column `legendary`.
- Find the maximum and minimum value of each column for each legendary groups using `.agg()` and save the resulting dataframe as `legendary_stats`.
- Display it.


<codeblock id="02_28">

- Are you grouping by the column named `legendary`?

Let's attempt to answer the question ***"Which pokemon type has the highest mean attack score?"*** by making a bar chart from a groupby object.

Tasks:       
Create a plot by chaining the following actions.   
- Make a groupby object on the column `type` and name it pokemon_type.
- Use `.mean()` on the new groupby object.
- reset the index so it no longer has `type` as index column.
- Use `reset_index()` to make `type` a column again.
- Sort the pokemon mean attack values in descending order using `sort` argument.
- Name the y-axis "Mean attack scores".
- Name the object `attack_plot`.


<codeblock id="02_30">

- Are you grouping by the column named `type`? 
- Are you using `.loc[:, 'attack']`?
- While sorting, are you using the argument `ascending=False`?
- Are you resetting the index?
- Are you giving your plot a title??
