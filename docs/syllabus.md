# Programming in Python for Data Science

## Time and Place
Online
Sept 22 – Oct 26, 2020

## Description
This course is part of the Key Capabilities for Data Science program and will teach you how to conduct data analysis in Python. 
During the course, you will work with powerful Python packages made for data-science, including Pandas for processing tabular data, Altair for data visualization and NumPy for working with numerical data types. 
You will also learn about iteration, flow control, and the data types relevant to data exploration and analysis. 
You will leave this course capable of processing raw data into a format suitable for analysis, writing your own analysis functions, and deriving data-driven insights via the creation of interactive visualizations and summary tables.

## Prerequisites
- None

## Content
We are using an interactive platform that contains have a series of slide decks accompanied with multiple choice questions and interactive coding exercises to apply what you learned during the module: [https://prog-learn.mds.ubc.ca/](https://prog-learn.mds.ubc.ca/)

## Course Software Platforms
Students will learn to write code and perform their analysis using the [Python Programming Language](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/). Assignments as well as the final project analysis will be done using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
Students will access the worksheets and tutorials in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/index.html#jupyter-notebooks) through [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/19078). 
Students will require a laptop, chromebook or tablet to complete this course.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Define tidy data and explain why it is an optimal format for data analysis.
1. Transform data into the tidy data format using pandas.
1. Demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as loops and conditionals.
1. Understand the key data structures in Python.
1. Read data into Python data from vanilla (e.g., .csv) and non-standard plain text files, as well as common spreadsheet file types (e.g., .xls).
1. Construct simple plots using pandas
1. Manipulate a single data table by:
    7.1 Filtering rows based on a criterion or combination of criteria
    7.2 Selecting variables
    7.3 Creating new variables and modifying pre-existing ones
    7.4 Rearranging the observations or variables by sorting.
1. Manage and manipulate data with dates and times, missing values and categorical variables as well as renaming dataframe columns.
1. Produce human-readable code that incorporates best practices of programming and coding style.

## Course Structure

There are 8 modules in total for this course. Each module will be accompanied by an autograded assignment due to be submitted. 
The student will be responsible to complete the material in 2 modules per week. In week 3, and 5 students will need to take an online 45 minute open book quiz testing, material from Modules 1-4 and 5-8 respectively. 
This quiz can be taken at any point during the week. At the end of the 8 modules student will have an individual project to complete where they are required to used the skills they learned in the course and produce an
analysis regarding an assigned dataset.


## Assignments

Each week students will submit 2 assignments for a grade. **Assignment due dates are posted on Canvas.** To open the assignment, click the link (e.g. `assignment_01`) from Canvas. 
To submit your assignment, just make sure your work is saved (File -> Save and Checkpoint to be sure) **on our server** (i.e., using the link from Canvas) before the deadline.  Our server will automatically snapshot at the due date/time.
We have supplied informative videos on how to do this in assignment 1 and referenced the links in subsequent assignments.

## Policies

### Late Assignments / Quiz Absence
Students who miss a quiz should make arrangements with the course facilitator as soon as possible. Failing to do so may result in a grade of zero. 

### Autograder Policy
Many of the questions in assignments are graded automatically by software. The grading computer has exactly the same hardware setup as the server that students work on. 
No assignment, when completed, should take longer than 5 minutes to run on the server. 
Furthermore, students are responsible for making sure their assignments are *reproducible*, and run from beginning to end on the autograding computer. 
In particular, **please ensure that any data that needs to be downloaded is done so by the assignment notebook with the correct filename to the correct folder.


### Re-grading
If you have concerns about the way your work was graded, please contact the course facilitator within one week of having the grade returned to you. After this one-week window, we may deny your request for re-evaluation. 
Also, please keep in mind that your grade may go up or down as a result of re-grading.

### Device/Browser
Students are responsible for using a device and browser compatible with all functionality of Canvas. 
Chrome or Firefox browsers are recommended; Safari has had issues with Canvas quizzes in the past.

### Academic Integrity 
The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the
assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.

### Plagiarism
Students must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:

- the reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)
- the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another 
- the generation of code by automatic code-generation software 

An “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.

The above attribution policy applies only to assignments. **No code or text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source during a quiz or exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a minimum, copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related question.**

**Repeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties**
