lyrics = '''When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me 
    Speaking words of wisdom Let it be And in my hour of darkness 
    She is standing right in front of me Speaking words of wisdom Let it be 
    Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be 
    Whisper words of wisdom Let it be 
    And when the broken - hearted people Living in the world agree 
    There will be an answer Let it be 
    For though they may be parted there is Still a chance that they will see 
    There will be an answer Let it be 
    Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be Yeah, there will be an answer Let it be 
    Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be Whisper words of wisdom Let it be 
    Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be Whisper words of wisdom Let it be 
    And when the night is cloudy There is still a light that shines on me 
    Shine until tomorrow Let it be 
    I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me 
    Speaking words of wisdom Let it be 
    Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be There will be an answer Let it be 
    Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be There will be an answer Let it be 
    Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be Whisper words of wisdom Let it be'''
